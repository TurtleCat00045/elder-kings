The SVN Development version requires the following portrait DLCs;

None.

Recent changes to how the mod loads portraits should mean you no longer require DLC to play the mod, however without the portrait DLCs all of the non-Mer, non-Beast races
will look identical to each other (or at best, "Western" and "Middle Eastern").


The mod uses the following portrait dlcs (but as previously stated, they are no longer required to run the mod);

Russian (Reachmen)
Norse (Nords, Skaal and Atmorans)
Celts (Bretons)
Africans (Yokudans & Redguard peoples)
Mongols (Akaviri)
Indians (Quey)
Mediterranean (Nibenean/Imperial)

In addition to play Republics you need the Republic DLC. Other DLCs are recommended for expanding available content but are not required.

No support will be given to make the SVN version compatible if you don't have these DLCs, the SVN isn't a general release and using it is at your own risk.
