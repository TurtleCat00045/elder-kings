Elder Kings features a relocalisation of the standard Calendar more in line with Elder Scrolls lore.
To help new players better recognise the days and the months we've included here a simple calendar.

There are 12 months in the year;

January 	~ Morning Star		0
February 	~ Sun's Dawn		1
March 		~ First Seed		2
April 		~ Rain's Hand		3
May 		~ Second Seed		4
June 		~ Mid Year			5
July 		~ Sun's Height		6
August 		~ Last Seed			7
September	~ Heartfire			8
October		~ Frostfall			9
November	~ Sun's Dusk		10
December	~ Evening Star		11

And 7 days in a week;

Monday		~ Morndas
Tuesday		~ Tirdas
Wednesday	~ Middas
Thursday	~ Turdas
Friday		~ Fredas
Saturday	~ Loredas
Sunday		~ Sundas


Unfortunately due to the way CK2 is setup we can't actually alter how the years and so on are displayed.
As we're restricted to using an "earth" dating, we calculate our years from year 1 of the first era.
