This includes the short notes on Cathnoquey's history from 3370 to the final bookmark.

3370 up to the Conquests of Uriel V BM
	
	- The Island of Zahedann and the island of Lankhmar should remain Chimer
	cultured and should be ruled by successive independent but variously intermarried
	Chimer Counts; feel free to rotate dynasties in and out of rulership to represent
	some kind of "elective" succession. The Chimer have no outward pressures, the
	small amount of lore we have on them suggests they get on fairly well with the
	neighbouring Quey humans; for this reason I suggest having the rulers by fairly
	long-lived (in EK terms, this means allowing it's ok to allow them to live upwards
	of 400 to 450 years, although I wouldn't have every single one live that long
	as nature still takes its course even on Mer, so a few shorter rules due to illness
	is fine).
	

	- Tulla should be held by a theocratic independent Archmage Count, a kind of
	"Quey" Mages Guild type place.
	
	- The rest of Cathnoquey should be held by a non-expanionist duchy level Republic.
	I say non-expanionist to mean they won't gain any additional Counties over
	history BMs, although what happens when game starts is anyones guess.
	
	
4097, Uriel's Conquests BM
	
	- At the start the island isn't occupied and no state of war exists, it should
	remain pretty much the same as before.
	
4215, Imperial Simulacrum (and on through Morrowind)
	- At the start of this bookmark, the island is still under imperial control. Like
	Roscrea it should have a "Viceroy" (Governor) of either Nord, Imperial or Breton
	culture holding it. The Viceroy title being the Duchy.
		- The Governor will hold Quey directly as his demesne, and Quey will have
		culture shifted to "Imperial" to represent the settling of Tamrielics and
		Legionaires. In addition the Governor will also hold Lankhmar, although it
		will remain Chimer cultured for now.
		
	- All other provinces will be vassals of the Governor.
		- Zahedann will maintain a Chimer Count and chimer culture.
		- Tulla will maintain it's theocratic Archmage status and will maintain Quey
		culture.
		- Namien will be ruled by a Tamrielic (author's choice of culture from Nord,
		Breton, Imperial or one of the Redguard cultures) but will maintain Quey
		culture.
		- Kamery will be ruled by a local Quey cultured Dynasty, and will maintain Quey
		culture.
		
4259, Oblivion Crisis
	- At the start of this bookmark, Cathnoquey is defacto independent. It is ruled by
	an Imperial cultured Duke (the "Governor") but is independent during the crisis
	to represent loss of centralised imperial control.
		- Kamery and Tulla will be at war with the Governor for independence.
		- Zahedann will already be independent but also at war with the governor in
		a claim war for Lankhmar.
		- The Governor will hold Quey and Lankhmar as his demesne. Namien will be
		held by the same dynasty that holds it in 4124.
		
	- Culture wise, Kamery, Tulla and Namien all remain Quey.
	- Zahedann is Chimer still.
	- Lankhmar has cultured shifted to Imperial (the Chimer mostly moved off to
	Zahedann, and the remaining Chimer have been marginalised to a minority).
	- Quey remains Imperial as previous BM.
	
4269, Stormcrown Interregnum
	- By this point the war is over and the Governor lost.
		- The Duchy of Cathnoquey has arisen to power, all the provinces of Cathnoquey
		are under it's rulership.
			- Kamery is the "capital" and is held by the ruling dynasty, Quey is also
			part of their demesne.
			- Tulla is held by the same theocratic mage people but is now a vassal of
			the Duke.
			- Namien is held by a new Quey dynasty.
			- Lankhmar and Zahedann are both held a single Chimer Count.
			
		- Culture Setup;
			- Kamery, Tulla, Namien are all Quey cultured.
			- Quey is still Imperial cultured.
			- Lankhmar has reverted to Chimer, and Zahedann remains Chimer.
			
			
4430 up to 4460 (the final BM)
	- The Duchy of Cathnoquey holds Kamery, Quey, Tulla and Namien.
		- The Dynasty that ruled Namien during 4179 are now the rulers of the duchy.
			- They hold Namien and Tulla as their demesne (the Mage theocracy is gone).
		- The dynasty that used to rule the duchy now hold only Kamery.
		
	- A new titular Duchy must be created which holds Quey, Lankhmar and Zahedann. It
	is ruled by the same Chimer dynasty that ruled Zahedann and Lankhmar in the prior
	BM.
		- Either Lankhmar or Quey can be assigned to a new Count-level Chimer dynasty
		as vassals of the Duchy.
		
	- Culture setup;
		- Kamery, Namien, Tulla and Quey are Quey cultured.
		- Lankhmar and Zahedann are Chimer cultured.
