Tang Mo's history needs to be rewritten (or at least reassigned to the new titles). Whomever "claims" this region is going to have to basically cannibilise what we've already gotten in the files, or create entirely new Tang Mo
history, but the great thing is they're free to create whatever dynasties they'd like and to setup the realm however they'd like. One caveat; the Tang Mo should be heavily decentralised, I (Korba) am personally in favour of
having every Island independent of the others (although some power-blocs are ok I guess).

I'll include in the plan .psd a new part specific to Tang Mo (check the "Tang Mo" group if you have Photoshop) to cover them from 3370 upto the final BM (they start holding more than just their islands in 3370, but gradually
lose land). The .psd will not reflect independents, it'll just have Tang Mo as one big mass (showing general "cultural" territory rather than independent realms), as previously said you can pretty much do what you want in Tang Mo,
just make it "messy" (monkeys are messy).
