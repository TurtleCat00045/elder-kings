Skyrim

Dawnstar inherited by Winterhold. Later splits up and becomes a proper jarldom once more.
Whiterun expands through straight conquest and politicking.
Winterhold inherits Dawnstar through marriage, battles Ghost Sea Merchants for control of Winterhold duchy too.
Ghost Sea Merchants take a bit of Winterhold-hold, fight the Jarl over it (eventually, after Winterhold inherits Dawnstar, they lose out)
Riften battles with Valtgard for control of the Rift. Black-Briars in the east fall under Riften control.
Morthal relatively static for now. Gets usurped down the line.
3698.1.1 is when Dawnstar and Winterhold become allies
