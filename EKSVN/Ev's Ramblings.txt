TODO list, long-term:
	** Finish Adventure/Blacksmithing system (Burnout)
	** Empire/Kingdom Collapse events
	* More Imperial Commune/Republic events
	* High Rock history files/tech review
	* Sexuality events
		* Actual trans event chain beyond just hist/alchemy-aided character gender swaps. It'll be a lot of work but I think if it's done right it'll be worth it in the end.
	* Soulburst!
	* Establishing chapters of guilds on other continents, I.E. Atmora
	* Jylkurfyk (Talk to Korba and Etienne?)
		* Shit ton of boats. Recruit commanders.
	* Trigger for disabling buildings when occupied by people that should not use them, I.E. Undead?
	
TODO list, short-term:
	*New undead features
		* Horde overhaul
		* New call-to-arms evil horde government. (Limbo)
		* When gaining province, get event to keep for self or assign to a new AI character
		* Summon undead via decision

	*Worm Cult events encouraging mages to become Necromancers?
	
	*Event to summon some troops from your guild if in a relevant society and in a defensive war. Archmages and Battlemages from Mage's Guild, mix of Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, and Archers from Fighter's Guild. 
		* Actually, targetted decision that uses society currency? We really need society currency uses.
		* Etienne, if you're reading my notes, know that I still support using society currency as the vector for advancing specializations instead of through the tombola.
		* "Just use retinues for certain special units instead of putting them in buildings, what the fuck are you doing Evelyn?" - Ev's 5 AM brilliance on New Year's Day
	
	*Finish spell rework to use the modulus system and new troop types. (Burnout also math is hard)
	*Infrastructure events, damage and repair.
	
	*Traits:
		Pacifist - prevents character from serving as marshal or leading troops, unlikely to accept duels and will NEVER offer duels.
		Dragonslayer - I don't know if I want this to be a trait, nickname, or event modifier, but a bit of a bonus to PCR and prestige ticking would work well for it. I want to tone down martial stacking.
		Divine - +8 to all stats, +50? combat_rating, same religion opinion bonus. For use for characters such as Orgnum, Mannimarco, and the Tribunal
	
	*Potions:
	*Artifacts:
		Add Shieldbreaker tags to certain artifacts
	
TODO list, immediate: (This is for my personal reference, you will probably never see this line change if you're looking through my notes)
	*none!
	
TODO list, characters:
	Verandis Ravenwatch's apprentices

Suggestions that I liked or thought weren't totally stupid at least:
	Society currency:
		* Get a random artifact from the rank up pool or a strongbox
		* Employ a new courtier with appropriate education and specializations
		* Trade for favors
		* Use to clear negative holding mods. This should be an alternative to money.
