orgnum.1.title;Orgnum is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.2.title;The Death of Orgnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2.accept;Orgnum is no more, and so the worship of him should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2.decline;Orgnum yet persists - he has ascended to Aetherius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2.others;How does this concern us, exactly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2;Orgnum, the god-king of the Maormer is dead. On his death, the hold he had on the inhabitants of Pyandonea has all but crumbled. Many of his former subjects are converting to a new school of thought that theorises that Orgnum was never a god as he claimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.11.t;The Godslayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.11.d;The inhabitants of Pyandonea are still in shock after the death of their God-King. Some rejoice, while some are devastated. But all Maormer agree on one thing. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] slew him. For better or worse, [Root.GetHerHis] actions directly lead to the death of Orgnum.\n\nFrom now on, [Root.GetSheHe] will be known as the God-Slayer, and [Root.GetHerHis] actions will be remembered for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.11.optA;Orgnum is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.t;Orgnum the Necromancer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.d;We have mastered the art of Necromancy and the manipulation of the dead. But this directly conflicts with a critical part of our faith, the worship of Meridia.\n\nThe Lady of Infinite Energy is in a perpetual battle against the undead and those who command them, which now includes us.\n\nThe faith of our people stands in danger when their divine leader and a core tenent of their faith clash. We must make a choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.optA;Our people will listen to their God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_MERIDIA_PYANDONEAIC_PANTHEON_CT;Meridia will be removed from the list of our Gods, our people won't be able to take her as a Patron God, and those who already have will have to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.optB;If we abandon Meridia, when will our people abandon us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.21.d;Our Divine [From.GetTitle] declared today that the teachings and orders of Meridia, the Lady of Infinite Energy, was in direct conflict with our faith, and has decided to remove her from our pantheon!\nWe have no choice but to stop worshipping her, and find another patron deity to worship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.21.optA;The will of Orgnum is sacred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.22.d;Orgnum, the [From.GetTitle] of the Maormer, has officially announced that Meridia was not to be worshipped anymore. Some say it is because he recently announced his mastery over the dead, which is something Meridia does not tolerate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.22.optA;Interesting changes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.t;Orgnum the Dragonborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.d;God-King of the Maormer. High Fane of the Pyandoneaic faithful. And now Dragonborn.\n\nAs a proof of our divine essence, the other Gods blessed our mortal form with the aspect of the Dragonborn, Master of Dragons, and rightful ruler of Tamriel.\n\nDozens of Dragons already flocked by our side, and it is said that some of our people started seeing them as Saints and heralds of our Divine will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.optA;Do venerate the Dragons, but don't forget they answer only to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADD_DRAGONS_PYANDONEAIC_PANTHEON_CT;The faithful will gain the ability to summon Dragons at the cost of piety;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.optB;I am their sole master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.31.d;Orgnum, God-King of the Maormer, has been blessed by the Gods and given the powers of the Dragonborns. Some say he always has several Dragons by his side, following him and those Orgnum deems worthy in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.31.optA;What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PYANDONEAIC_RELIGION_WORSHIPS_DRAGONS;The Pyandoneaic faith sees Dragons as Heralds of Orgnum, and can summon some to fight for them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.t;Orgnum the Lycanthrope;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.d;The people of Tamriel forgot the strong bond they used to have with nature and the wild. The land blesses us with its fertile soil, the sea are full of sacred Sea Serpents, and the winds help us sail.\n\nTo return to these roots, you officially showed its people the powers of the lycanthrope, and your ability to shapeshift at will.\n\nSome of our people are already making shrines to the Prince of the Hunt, while other are waiting for us to officialize the Prince's entry in our pantheon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.optA;The Father of Lycanthropy shows us how to reunite with nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADD_HIRCINE_PYANDONEAIC_PANTHEON_CT;Hircine, Prince of the Hunt and Father of Werewolves, will be available as a patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.optB;This privilege and power should be exclusive to their God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.41.d;Orgnum, God-King of the Maormer, officially announced that Hircine, Daedric Prince of the Hunt and Father of Lycanthropes, would join the Pyandoneaic pantheon.\n\nSome speculate this is because he recently revealed his lycanthropy to the world, and that might just be to avoid being hunted down by his followers or the neighbouring realms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.41.optA;Interesting changes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum_reclaim_pyandonea;Reclaim Pyandonea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum_reclaim_pyandonea_desc;Our home island has been under attack by dangerous heretics for too long. We extended our divine mercy to these heathens, hoping they would rejoin the light of their God-King, but to no avail. We have to crush them and force them to kneel, if we want our people to be safe and bask in our Divine glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ORGNUM_RECLAIM_PYANDONEA_CT;Pyandonea will finally know peace and safety under its God-King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.100.t;God-King of all Maormer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.100.d;Pyandonea was drowning in flames. Daedric cultists, former Altmer traditionalists, and other dangerous heathens plagued the land and its people. It was said that countless storms hit every coast of the island, Sea-Serpents were hunting and destroying fishing ships, and the shrines erected by our people would be destroyed at nightfall.\n\nWe have had no choice but to crush all those that threatened our people, and to show our loyal subject that their God-King would not abandon them.\n\nPyandonea is safe, our people are safe. The streets are chanting my name, and the land is grateful for their God-King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.100.optA;Pyandonea is reunited under my Divine will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PYANDONEA_PROVINCES_PROSPERITY_BONUS_CT;All the provinces in Pyandonea receive a prosperity bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.110.t;Orgnum, God of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.110.d;Remember in eons long since passed when our own kin, the hated Altmeri, cast us from our hearth and home.\nOur people came to this once cursed land divided, but together we pierced the mists that sought to blind and deceive us, tamed the beasts of land and sea that sought to devour us and broke the backs of those that sought to defy us. Now our land, this Pyandonea, stands united, but it is not enough to simply survive. To flourish we must look back into our past. We will have our vengeance and we will reclaim our birthright, we will retake that which we were denied!\n\nSummon our Serpents, those titans of the waves! Summon your soldiers, don your armors and gather your arms! Soon we will sail for the Eternal Isle and the Maormeri will rise triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.110.optA;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.111.d;Pyandonea is in ebullition! Its God-King, Orgnum, has recently reclaimed the whole island, and his faithful rebuilt the giant temple in the center of the kingdom. Hundreds of zealots flock by the side of Pyandonea's ruler every day, ready for war against their now greatest rivals - the Altmer of Alinor.\n\nOrgnum wishes to extend his dominion over the Summerset Isles, and his followers are more than eager to conquer it for him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.111.optA;It seems that peace isn't an option...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.115.d;For a moment, peace surrounds you. Alinor, the greatest city of the Summerset Isles, is firmly under your control, and its population deeply loyal to their new God. The task is not yet done, as some parts of the island still doesn't accept your rightful authority.\n\nBut you can rest for now, knowing you did more in the last couple of years than what your people would think possible mere decades ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.115.optA;We aren't done yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ORGNUM_CAN_GIVE_TEMPLE_ORGNUM_SACRISTAN_CT;You are now able to delegate your §YTemple§! to a §YSacristan§!, should you wish to move your capital. To assert total control over the Summerset Isles, you will have to §Ycompletely control the region§!, and build a §YRuler Statue§! in the county of Alinor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.120.d;It is finally done. Millenia after being expelled from Alinor, we finally were able to come back, and with great force. The Altmer have been forced to proclaim me their now rightful overlord, and your hegemony over both Pyandonea and Alinor is total.\n\nYou and your people can finally rest, their thirst for vengeance satisfied.\n\nNo one will be able to stand up to you now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.120.optA;The Maormer stand triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.121.d;As Emperor of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName], and after achieving total victory over the Altmer, your people have started to call you God-Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.121.optA;As it should always have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.200.t;The Temple of Orgnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x1
orgnum.200.d;Ages ago, our people built a grand temple in our name. It was the center of our power, and without it our Divine authority was greatly diminished. Our recent reconquests of our island finally allowed us to reclaim our Temple.\n\nWe should repair it immediately, less our people would slowly lose faith in our divinity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.200.optA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.201.d;Reparations on our Temple have recently begun. It will take several years due the centuries of heathen occupation and looting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.201.optA;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.202.d;After years of hard work from our people, our Temple is finally repaired. There still are halls to repair and wings to refurnish, but we are already able to lead our people from here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.202.optA;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.203.d;Our Temple is now bigger than it has ever been before, thanks to years of hard work and the unwavering faith of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.203.optA;I will not fail them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.500.t;The Divine Dragonborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.500.d;Over the centuries many claimed to have been blessed by the Gods, and given dominion over the realm of men. They claimed that only them could wear the Amulet of Kings and use its power to seal the barrier between Mundus and Oblivion, and that even the dragons, seen as lesser deities in some cultures, would bow to them.\nIt is time for us to dismiss these claims, and show that only us, the God-Emperor of the Maormer, is fit to the title of Dragonborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.500.optA;I hope it will work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RITUAL_ORGNUM_DRAGONBORN_CT;The Amulet will only be worn by those with the Dragonblood. But with a sufficient demonstration of divine power, it should obey to us as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.501.d;The time has come. As my people cheer, I enter the former Temple of the One, where the Dragonfires are kept. The Amulet of Kings has been prepared and attuned to my divine essence, and is ready to be worn. As I raise it above my head and place it around my neck, the Dragonfires flash, blinding all those around. But not me. As those around slowly get their vision back, they can see the Dragonfires burning, and the Amulet of Kings still around my neck.\n\nThey now cheer, and shout "Dragonborn, Dragonborn!" all around me.\nThe ritual worked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.501.optA;Proof of my divine powers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.502.d;The time has come. As my people cheer, I enter the former Temple of the One, where the Dragonfires are kept. The Amulet of Kings has been prepared and attuned to my divine essence, and is ready to be worn. As I raise it above my head and place it around my neck, the Dragonfires flash, blinding all those around. When the crowd gets its vision back, they see, to my horror, the Dragonfires still being extinguished...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.502.optA;The Amulet rejected me... But how??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.503.d;The time has come. As my people cheer, I enter the former Temple of the One, where the Dragonfires are kept. The Amulet of Kings has been prepared and attuned to my divine essence, and is ready to be worn. As I raise it above my head and place it around my neck, the Amulet violently rejects me. An intense burst of energy shatters the Amulet, and all those around... Including me. It overpowers my divinity, and I have barely the time to take a final breath before my body, along with the Temple of the One, explodes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.503.optA;W-Why...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
AOK_CANNOT_BE_FOOLED_CT;The Amulet of Kings cannot be fooled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DEATH_RITUAL_AOK;was destroyed when attempting to corrupt a divine artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ritual_aok_failed;Failed to wear the Amulet of Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
