JJ Systems Info (aka just pretend this is Confluence)
A smattering of things that are actually their own systems and also some quick fixes/little bits attached to other systems to pad the document and because I ~~feel~~ felt like typing but don't have the heart to launch CK2 and test what I'm currently working on again ~~tonight~~ that night

##### SYSTEMS WITH A PRESENCE ON TRUNK

* Ideal Masters
	* STABLE DEPLOYMENT

	* Offmap Power
		* Rather than having statuses and policies, the Ideal Masters offmap's ability to grant boons is limited by the souls the Masters have received from their adherents
		* Certain boons can be borrowed with a small down payment and ongoing payment schedule of souls (forced harvesting). The Masters frown upon those who try to cheat them
		* Ideal Invasion deal - soldiers and special soul harvest CB granted. Special additional levels of soul harvesting granted to gain more piety but depop faster. The glass canon equivalent of Daedric Invasions

* Elder Council
	* INDEV DEPLOYMENT - MEDIUM PRIORITY

	* Society
		* INDEV DEPLOYMENT - LOW PRIORITY
		* Quests for travelling to the Imperial City or administrating regions of the Empire
		* Participate in Council votes
		* Membership criteria changes based on policies
		* Could do with some more abilities/perks for ordinary society members

	* Legislation
		* INDEV DEPLOYMENT - LOW PRIORITY
		* Various policies dictating the authority of the Elder Council with respect to the Empire and Emperor
		* Councillors pledge allegiance to either the Imperialist or Aristocratic factions based on their affinity with each
		* The Emperor can veto most Council votes

	* Swaying
		* INDEV DEPLOYMENT - MEDIUM PRIORITY
		* The Emperor can make deals with members of the Council for short-term boosts to their Imperialist affinity
		* Still need to port some pre-rebuild decisions
		* Culture flag persistence bug prevents certain options from being implemented for the time being

	* Imperial Guard
		* INDEV LOCAL STAGING - LOW PRIORITY
		* Mainly a proof of concept/excercise rather than something intended for release
		* Possibly destined for zDevs or a submod
		* The Ruby Throne can create an Imperial Guard unit
		* Various assignments available to the guard, from assisting the legions and protecting the imperial household to threatening members of the Council (hello Uriel VI)
		* Guard has a distinct personality (competence, loyalty, morality, what-have-you) which is slowly affected by their appointed commander
		* A disloyal guard does not make for a happy Emperor

* Firing Character Events From Society Scopes
	* STABLE DEPLOYMENT
	* Ancient secret of the JJ family
	* Improves performance
	* Allows you to define your own scopes
	* Fixes persistence of culture flags when resigning and starting a new game

	* Added patron gods to the Quey religion

* Akaviri Flavour
	* INDEV DEPLOYMENT - LOW PRIORITY
	
	* Akaviri Human Cultural Titles

	* Akaviri Human Empire
		* STABLE DEPLOYMENT
		* Requires Akaviri humans to be dominant in their former land in addition to normal empire requirements

	* Akaviri Bloodlines
		* STABLE DEPLOYMENT
		* More may need to be added/adjusted as history progresses

	* Akaviri Trade Routes
		* INDEV LOCAL STAGING - LOW PRIORITY
		* Tamrielic trade routes... but in Akavir instead of Tamriel!
		* Kind of ugly, trying out different configurations

	* Kamal Pilgrimage
		* STABLE DEPLOYMENT
		* Special pilgrimage event to wander the mountains and tundra in Kamal
		* Could probably do with some more events

	* Confederacy
		* STABLE DEPLOYMENT

##### SYSTEMS WITH A PRESENCE ON BRANCH

* Maormerian [sic] Religion After Orgnum
	* INDEV LOCAL STAGING - LOW PRIORITY
