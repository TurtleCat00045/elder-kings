This is the entire history of Roscrea from 3370 up to the final bookmark.



	3370, 3461, 3492, 3502
	- Atmoran culture rules the island for the entire period.
	- It should be basically similar to Solstheim with each County ruled independently by
	a different Dynasty.
	- Heavy intermarriage between the Dynasties is fine, and changing them up every so often
	is also ok.
	
	3750, 3782, 3784, 3826, 3864
	- Atmoran culture still rules.
	- One dynasty can now be given 2 Counties to rule, the other 3 should remain independent.
		- The 2 county dynasty should maintain these two counties across this time period.
	- Keep the heavy intermarriage up (some "inbreeding" is probable lol)
	
	3936, 3947, 4075
	- Atmoran culture still rules.
	- The one dynasty that gained the two Counties should now be opposed by another dynasty
	who has also gained 2 Counties. There should still be a 3rd independent Dynasty ruling
	the 5th County. They shouldn't be married to either Dynasty at this point.
	- A Conflict can spring up between the two competing dynasties sometime around 4075.
	
	4097
	- Atmoran culture still rules.
	- This is the time of Uriel V's conquest of Roscrea. Roscrea by this point should be held
	in dominion at Duchy level by a single Dynasty, although this dynasty's personal demesne
	should be no greater than 2 Counties, with the other 3 Counties ruled by 3 different
	dynasties.
	- At the start of the bookmark, Roscrea will be at war with the Empire, and the County of
	Merrick and Cronan should already be occupied by two Imperial Legions.
		- This is basically a no-win situation for Roscrea, they start partially occupied and
		are severely outnumbered.
		
	4215, 4253
	- Roscrea should be ruled now by either a Nibenean, Imperial or Colovian dynasty as a
	Viceroy title ("Imperial Governor" basically; when he dies it reverts to the Emperor).
	- Cronan, the small eastern island of Roscrea, should by this point be "Imperial" cultured.
	- The Governor should hold only Cronan as his demesne.
		- Merrick should be an atmoran culture province, but ruled by a new landholder; either
		Breton, Nord or Imperial.
		- One of the other Counties should be a non-Atmoran (Breton, Nord or Imperial)
		- The other two Counties can be ruled by Atmorans.
		
	- Only changes from 4215 to 4253 really should perhaps be a culture shift within Merrick
	to whatever the culture of it's holder is that you decide (either Breton, Nord or Imperial)
	and also a change of Governor/Viceroy (a different dynasty to the previous viceroy).
	
	4259
	- The Governor who controls Roscrea in 4162 now holds it as an actual title and not just
	a viceroy anymore.
	- Cronan, Merrick and the other non-Atmoran held county should by now be culture shifted,
		Cronan Imperial as per previous bookmark, the other two whatever the culture of their
		holding dynasty is.
	- The Governor has dispossessed the remaining Atmoran Counts (no more playable Atmorans by
	this point). Although these two provinces remain Atmoran cultured.
	
	
	4269
	- The Duchy of Roscrea is held by the ruler of Solitude as a second Duchy.
		- The last remaining Atmoran cultured provinces are to be switched to Nord by this point.
		- All Counties are ruled by Nords, any non-Nords are to be dispossessed and replaced.
		- With the exception of the Atmoran cultured provinces being switched to Nord, the others
		should remain as they were in the previous Bookmark.
		
	4430
	- Little should change from 4179. It is now firmly a part of Solitude's realm. The ruler of
	Solitude however doesn't necessarily have to also hold Roscrea, but the Duchy should be within
	their Dynasty (and realm; by this date Solitude is a Kingdom level title again).
	- Entire island should be Nord cultured except Cronan which remains an Imperial enclave, it's
	capital should be changed to a City holding and it should be ruled by an unplayable Imperial
	Mayor.
	
	4460
	- No change from 4430.
